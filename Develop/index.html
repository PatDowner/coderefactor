<!-- What's the best practices around how often you add/commit/push files to the repo?
    
    What's the exact practical function of each step? I know Q had mentioned there's a way to do only some of those steps but not all of them to, in effect, create a bread crumb like trail of a history of edits.
    
    Also, when you type a commit message, is there a way to do it for each file?? -->
